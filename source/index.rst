News
========
2025.04.10 S3RL is now available on GitHub at https://github.com/AI4Bread/S3RL.  
S3RL is implemented based on PyTorch Geometric (pyG) and supports efficient training and flexible batch processing for large-scale spatial transcriptomics datasets.  

The model provides enhanced spatial representation learning through the use of a Graph Transformer architecture and hyperspherical prototype clustering for clear domain separation.  
Please refer to Tutorials 7 and 8 for training strategies and batch processing guidance.

Introduction
========
S3RL is a novel framework designed for spatial clustering, denoising, and interpretation of spatially resolved transcriptomics (ST) data. 

By leveraging a Graph Transformer encoder and hyperspherical prototype clustering, S3RL effectively captures both gene expression patterns and spatial dependencies.  
It constructs a separable embedding space where cells with similar transcriptional and spatial features are compactly grouped while maintaining angular separation across distinct spatial domains.

The learned low-dimensional embeddings and reconstructed expression matrices can be directly used for a variety of downstream tasks, including spatial domain identification, visualization, spatial trajectory inference, denoising, and multi-slice or 3D tissue integration.
